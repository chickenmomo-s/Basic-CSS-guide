One cool thing about id attributes is that, like classes, you can style them using CSS.

Important notes-
1.  An id is not reusable and should only be applied to one element.
2.  An id also has a higher specificity (importance) than a class so if both are applied to the same element and have conflicting styles, the styles of the id will be applied.

Here's an example of how you can take your element with the id attribute and give it the background color of green

Write this in your style block:

#name-of-id {
  background-color: green;
}

Note that inside your style element,
  You always reference classes by putting a . in front of their names.
  You always reference ids by putting a # in front of their names.
