After you create your variable, you can assign its value to other CSS properties by referencing the name you gave it.

background: var(--penguin-skin);
This will change the background of whatever element you are targeting to gray because that is the value of the --penguin-skin variable.
  Note that other styles in your code will not be applied unless the variable names are an exact match.

When using your variable as a CSS property value, you can attach a fallback value that your browser will revert to if the given variable is invalid.

Note: This fallback is not used to increase browser compatibility, and it will not work on IE browsers.
  Rather, it is used so that the browser has a color to display if it cannot find your variable.

Here's how you do it:

background: var(--penguin-skin, black);

This will set background to black if your variable wasn't set. Note that this can be useful for debugging.
