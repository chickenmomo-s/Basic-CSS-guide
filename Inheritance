When you create a variable, it is available for you to use inside the selector in which you create it. It also is available in any of that selector's descendants.
  This happens because CSS variables are inherited, just like ordinary properties.

To make use of inheritance, CSS variables are often defined in the :root element.

:root is a pseudo-class selector that matches the root element of the document, usually the html element.

By creating your variables in :root, they will be available globally and can be accessed from any other selector in the style sheet.

  :root {
    /* Only change code below this line */

    /* Only change code above this line */
  }
  
  
When you create your variables in :root they will set the value of that variable for the whole page.

You can then over-write these variables by setting them again within a specific element.

Example:

Change the property in the class or id of the element you want to change,
    it will override the condition given in the root element.
    It will be changed only for that element. For the other elements, the value assigned in the root element will be used.
