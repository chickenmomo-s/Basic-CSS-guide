Sometimes your HTML elements will receive multiple styles that conflict with one another.

For example, your h1 element can't be both green and pink at the same time.

If you create a class to color a particular element, then the color prescirbed in the class will override the color prescribed by the body element.

In case two classes are created to apply color over the same element,
  then the second declaration will always take precedence over the first. Because the second class is declared second, it overrides the attributes of the first class.
  
 Note: It doesn't matter which order the classes are listed in the HTML element.
