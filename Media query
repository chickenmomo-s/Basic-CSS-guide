CSS Variables can simplify the way you use media queries.

For instance, when your screen is smaller or larger than your media query break point, 
  you can change the value of a variable, and it will apply its style wherever it is used.
  
Example- 
@media (max-width: 350px) {
    :root {
      /* Only change code below this line */

      /* Only change code above this line */
    }
  }
  
Change the values of certain elements in this root selector media query so that it redefined to a different value.
  Then check your output.
