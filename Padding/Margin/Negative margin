Three important properties control the space that surrounds each HTML element: padding, border, and margin.

An element's padding controls the amount of space between the element's content and its border.

exapmle - padding: 15px;

An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.

example - margin: 20px;

If you set an element's margin to a negative value, the element will grow larger.

example - margin: -15px;
